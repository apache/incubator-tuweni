/**
 * Starts new co-routine and returns its result as an implementation of [AsyncCompletion].
 * The running co-routine is cancelled when the resulting future is cancelled or otherwise completed.
 *
 * Co-routine context is inherited from a [CoroutineScope], additional context elements can be specified with [context]
 * argument. If the context does not have any dispatcher nor any other [ContinuationInterceptor], then
 * [Dispatchers.Default] is used. The parent job is inherited from a [CoroutineScope] as well, but it can also be
 * overridden with corresponding [coroutineContext] element.
 *
 * By default, the co-routine is immediately scheduled for execution. Other options can be specified via `start`
 * parameter. See [CoroutineStart] for details. A value of [CoroutineStart.LAZY] is not supported (since
 * `AsyncResult` framework does not provide the corresponding capability) and produces [IllegalArgumentException].
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext][CoroutineScope.newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are
 * available for newly created co-routine.
 *
 * @param context Additional to [CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] context of the coroutine.
 * @param start Co-routine start option. The default value is [CoroutineStart.DEFAULT].
 * @param block The co-routine code.
